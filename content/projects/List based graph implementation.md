Implemented list structure/adjacency matrix to satisfy graph. The Nodes and edges are to be fed from an input file requiring file handling. It ultimately returns the number of cuts and crossings based on the list/matrix.

Extra: requires creating a placeholder node to delete any node input for deletion and return the cuts and crossings of the new graph.
